# Compilers Project
My final project in the Compilers class was an ambitious endeavor that challenged me to create a lexer/parser capable of recognizing and compiling Java programs, albeit with certain limitations.

This assignment made a significant contribution to my computer science and college-wide learning goals in various ways:

### System-Level Understanding of the Computer: 
This project deepened my comprehension of computer systems, particularly in the realm of programming languages and compilation processes. It required me to delve into the intricate workings of coding languages, parsing techniques, and the generation of machine code. This knowledge provided me with insights into the lower-level aspects of computing.

### Concepts and Techniques of Software Design: 
While the description of this project doesn't explicitly mention software design, it undoubtedly involved designing and implementing a complex software componentâ€”a lexer/parser. This required careful planning and meticulous attention to detail, reinforcing my software design skills.

### Project Experience in Group Setting: 
While the project was completed with a partner, it still provided me with valuable experience in a collaborative setting. Working closely with someone to tackle a complex task taught me the importance of effective communication, coordination, and division of responsibilities in a group project.

### Problem Solving Skills: 
The compilers project was undeniably challenging, pushing the boundaries of problem-solving. It forced me to explore the intricacies of the Java API and understand it deeply to address any issues or obstacles encountered during the development process. This experience honed my problem-solving skills and demonstrated the importance of resourcefulness and adaptability in overcoming hurdles.

In summary, the Compilers project not only expanded my understanding of computer systems but also enhanced my software design abilities, teamwork skills, and problem-solving capabilities. It was a pivotal assignment that aligns with both my computer science and college-wide learning goals.
